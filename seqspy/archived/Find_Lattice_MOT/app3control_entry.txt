14 = Find Lattice MOT, - Attempt to load lattice beams from the red MOT, use fluorescence imaging.%n%nCNC the red mot, then turn on IR beams, overlapping a little bit with the mot, given by [FINDLATTICE:MOToverlap].  The powers used for the IR beams are [FINDLATTICE:irpow#].  There are no parameters to determine which IR beams are turned on, this is hardcoded in the sequence. The ODT can optionally be turned on as well via [FINDLATTICE:odt]. The ODT power if on can be set by [FINDLATTICE:odtpow].  This one stays at low field and attempts a fluorescence shot with the mot beams.  The mot light and field is turned off and then it waits a time-of-flight given by [FINDLATTICE:tof].  The pictures are taken with the andor.
