15 = Find Lattice UVMOT, - Attempt to load lattice beams from the UVMOT, use fluorescence imaging.%n%nSimilar to Find Lattice MOT.  This one does the UVMOT and then uses [FINDLATTICE:MOToverlap], [FINDLATTICE:tof] to determine the timing and [FINDLATTICE:odt], [FINDLATTICE:odtpow] and [FINDLATTICE:irpow#] to determine whether the ODT is also turned on and to determine the ODT and IR powers.
