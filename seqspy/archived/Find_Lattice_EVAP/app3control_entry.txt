16 = Find Lattice Evap, - Attempt to load lattice while doing evaporation in the ODT, use fluoresence imaging.%n%nThis one turns on the lattice beams at the very start.  Then does UVMOT, loads the ODT, goes to high field and starts evaporating.  It evaporates during EVAP:image and then the field is brought to zero again in 50 ms.  After 50 ms at lowfield the ODT is releases, and after a time of flight given by [FINDLATTICE:odttof], the MOT beams are flashed to take a fluorescence image with the andor cmera.
